ubi8/httpd-24;1;2024-08-01T13:08:40Z;redhat;CVE-2023-43804;fixed in 2.0.6, 1.26.17;high;urllib3;1.24.2;8,1;2023-10-04 17:15:10;2023-10-03 05:52:10;urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn\'t treat the `Cookie` HTTP header special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user. However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP redirects to a different origin if that user doesn\'t disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5.;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43804
ubi8/httpd-24;1;2024-08-01T13:08:40Z;redhat;CVE-2024-6345;fixed in 70.0.0;high;setuptools;39.2.0;8,8;2024-07-15 01:15:01;2024-07-15 19:50:46;A vulnerability in the package_index module of pypa/setuptools versions up to 69.1.1 allows for remote code execution via its download functions. These functions, which are used to download packages from URLs provided by users or retrieved from package index servers, are susceptible to code injection. If these functions are exposed to user-controlled inputs, such as package URLs, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. The issue is fixed in version 70.0.;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6345
